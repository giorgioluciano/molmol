# Atom Builder for Blender

A Blender add-on for **scientific molecular 3D modeling** using the iconic 
teaching model  atomic representation style. Build publication-ready molecular structures 
with **automatic bond detection** via the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), 
customizable atom geometries, and advanced rendering options.

## Features

- **real-style atoms**: Import or build molecules with the classic colored-sphere-and-stick representation used in scientific publications.
- **Automatic bond detection**: Uses ASE to infer bonds from atomic coordinates (supports PDB, CIF formats).
- **Flexible atom collections**: Reference external Blender `.blend` libraries with sp³, sp², sp, bent, and other hybridization geometries.
- **Bond customization**: Control bond radius, gap distance, and hydrogen handling.
- **Publication-ready**: Generate high-quality renders suitable for academic papers, theses, and presentations.
- **Batch processing**: Import and process multiple structures in a single workflow.

## Use Cases

- Academic research and scientific visualization
- Materials science and computational chemistry
- Educational content and molecular modeling
- 3D printing of molecular structures
- Publication figures for chemistry and materials papers
